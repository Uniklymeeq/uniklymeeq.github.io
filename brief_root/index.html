<p><center>Our tagrget demographic will be men and women between the ages of 16 - 40 years of age. We desire to cater to musically versatile listeners whom are passionate about discovering electronic music. We desire to reach the sonically curious, the musically mischevious, and listeners who revolve their lives around audio(maybe even those making music themselves). By focusing on what's happening in London's electronic music scene, we hope to shine a light on the unique, unexplored culture. </p></center>

<center><u><h2>MISSION:</h2></u></center>

<center><p>Here at I.E We will highlight, review, share and explore unique London producers, bands, and artists whom are creating music outside the status quo and doing so independently. Since electronic music can overlap many different genres, the thread in all the music we explore will be rooted in electronic that is exploring new musical terrain. </p></center>
